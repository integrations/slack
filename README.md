# GitHub + Slack Integration
[![Join Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Slack-e01563.svg)](https://github-slack-app.herokuapp.com/slack/deep/open?team=T6Y4KP8ES)

## Running locally
You'll will need to set up your own Slack and GitHub test apps.
Instructions to follow on how to do that.

## Issues & PRs methodology
When a new issue or PR gets created on GitHub, a message is posted in Slack.
If there are minor updates that happen to this issue or PR on GitHub (label added, new comment, etc.) those changes will be reflected in the message originally posted in Slack.
If there are major updates to the issue/PR (closing, re-opening, merging), those changes will also be reflected by updating the original message, and additionally a new message will be posted which concisely states the major change.
