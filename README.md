## Installing the GitHub integration for Slack
### Requirements
This app officially supports GitHub.com and Slack.com but the team plans to support GitHub Enterprise and Slack Enterprise Grid in the future.

### Migrating from the legacy GitHub integration for Slack
So, you've decided to migrate! When you install the new GitHub integration for Slack in your Slack Workspace, all existing configurations on the legacy app will be disabled. The GitHub integration for Slack will prompt you with a list of the previous configurations allowing you to re-enable those configurations for the new app.

### Installation
[Install the GitHub integration for Slack ](https://slack.com/apps/A8GBNUWU8-github). After you've signed in to your Slack workspace, you will be prompted to give the app access:

After the app is installed, you will see **public** links to GitHub issues, pull requests, and code rendered as rich text via a [Slack unfurl](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-link-unfurling) in your workspace.

### Subscribing and Unsubscribing

At this point, your Slack and GitHub user accounts are not linked. To link the two accounts, authenticate to GitHub using a `/github` slash command, `/github signin`.

The `/github` slash command also accepts a `subscribe` argument that you can use to subscribe to an Organization or Repository's activity `/github subscribe <organization>/<repository>`.

The `/github` slash command also supports `unsubscribe`. To unsubscribe to notifications from a repository, use `/github unsubscribe <organization>/<repository>`

### Authorization
By granting the app access, you are providing the following authorizations to your GitHub and Slack accounts:

#### Slack Permission Scopes

|Permission scope|Why we need it|
|---|---|
|Access private conversations between you and the App | To message you with instructions.  |
|View links to GitHub.com in messages| To render rich links from `github.com`|
|Add link previews to GitHub.com to messages| To render rich links to `github.com`|
|Add slash commands| To add the `/github` slash command to your Slack workspace |
|View the workspace or organization's name, email domain, and icon| To store subscriptions you set up|
|Post messages as the app| To notify you of activity that happens on GitHub, in Slack|

#### GitHub Permission Scopes

|Permission scope|Why we need it|
|---|---|
|Read access to code| To render code snippets in Slack|
|Read access to commit statuses, deployments, issues, metadata, pull requests, and repository projects | To render previews of links shared in Slack|

### Repository Activity
**Subscribe to an Organization or a Repository**
On repositories, the app notifies of `open`, `close`, and `re-open` events on pull requests and issues in repositories you've subscribed to. It also notifies of any `push` directly to the repository's default branch.

All event notifications will render rich notifications (unfurls) including more information about the parent pull request or issue.

### Types of Link Unfurls
When a user posts a GitHub link in Slack, the app is designed to unfurl **issues and pull requests**,
directly linked **comments**, code **blobs** with line numbers, as well as **organizations, repositories, and users**.
