# GitHub Open Source Applications Terms and Conditions

These GitHub Open Source Applications Terms and Conditions ("Application Terms") are a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an entity) and GitHub, Inc. regarding your use of GitHub's applications, such as the GitHub integration for Slack and associated documentation (the "Application"). These Application Terms apply to the executable code version of the Application. Source code for the Application (the "Software") is available separately and free of charge under open source software license agreements.

If you are agreeing to these Application Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates, and all Users who access the Application on its behalf to these Application Terms. If you do not have authority, you must not accept these Application Terms and you may not use the Application.

If you do not agree to all of the terms in these Application Terms, do not download, install, use, or copy the Application.

Privacy Sandbox for the Web
Privacy Sandbox for the Web will phase out third-party cookies
 by using the latest privacy techniques, like differential privacy,
 k-anonymity,
 and on-device processing.


Privacy Sandbox also helps to limit other forms of tracking, like fingerprinting,
 by restricting the amount of information sites can access so that your information stays private, safe, and secure.

The Privacy Sandbox Timeline for the Web
The Privacy Sandbox proposals are in various stages of the development process. This timeline reflects when we expect new privacy-preserving APIs and other technologies to be ready in support of key use cases, so that Chrome can responsibly phase out third-party cookies. Information may change and will be updated monthly.

The proposals are being developed in public forums, in collaboration with members of the industry. We also continue to work with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority in line with the commitments we offered for Privacy Sandbox for the web. We encourage participation through the many public feedback channels that inform development of the proposals. Stakeholders can also use this form to share feedback directly with Chrome.

This timeline reflects Chrome’s best estimates, as of December 2023, of the timing of the key Privacy Sandbox use cases, including the availability of origin trials, readiness at scale of the listed APIs, and ending support for third-party cookies. Dates are subject to change. Chrome will update this timeline monthly with current estimates.
The timeline lists the use cases that Chrome plans to support before the transition period: Fighting spam and fraud on the web; Measuring digital ads; Showing relevant content and ads; Strengthening cross-site privacy boundaries. The APIs listed under each use case reflect Chrome’s current proposals to support this use case. The specific APIs are subject to change.
General Availability will start once APIs for all of the use cases are ready for scaled adoption. Chrome will announce the start of the transition period on this site and on the Keyword blog.
