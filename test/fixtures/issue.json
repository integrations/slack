  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThe Apache Software Foundation Legal Affairs Committee [has announced][1] that the so-called 'Facebook BSD+Patents License' is no longer allowed to be used as a direct dependency in Apache projects.\r\n\r\nThis has lead to a lot of upset and frustration in the Apache community, especially from projects requiring similarly-licensed code as direct dependencies - the chief of these being RocksDB.\r\n\r\nHowever, we (the Apache Software Foundation) have just received word that [RocksDB will be re-licensing their code under the dual Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2 licenses][2]. \r\n\r\nAs a user of React.JS in an ASF top-level project (Apache CouchDB), please consider re-licensing React.JS under similar terms. Otherwise, many ASF projects such as our own will have to stop relying on and building with React.\r\n\r\nA previous bug (#9760) suggested I mention @lacker in this issue when asking licensing questions, so I'm doing so.\r\n\r\nThank you kindly for your consideration.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16088663\r\n[2]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088730&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16088730",
